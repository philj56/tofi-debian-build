# [Tofi](https://github.com/philj56/tofi) Debian tools
This is a set of tools used to automatically generate a
[tofi](https://github.com/philj56/tofi) `.deb` package for debian-like systems,
specifically meant to run on Ubuntu 20.04. You really shouldn't try to run this
on your machine, or if you do, at least do it in a VM.
